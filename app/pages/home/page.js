                            South African Stress and Health (SASH) study reporting that around 30% of the population
                            will experience a mental disorder in their lifetime.</p>

                   id="1:121">Additionally, the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (SADAG) estimates that
                    approximately 1 in 6 South Africans suffer from anxiety, depression, or substance abuse disorders.
                    The suicide rate in South Africa, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) data for 2016,
                    was approximately 13.8 per 100,000 population. Unfortunately, mental health stigma persists, as
                    highlighted by a study conducted by the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) in 2008, revealing
                    that 78% of South Africans believe individuals with mental health problems are unfit for work.
                    Access to mental health services remains a challenge, with the SASH study indicating that only 15%
                    of South Africans with a mental health disorder received treatment in the year preceding the study.
                    Socioeconomic factors such as financial stress and unemployment significantly contribute to mental
                    health problems in the country, according to the South African Depression and Anxiety Group
                    (SADAG).</p>
